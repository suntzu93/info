```
CPU Utilization
    Current CPU Busy: 4.5%
    System Load: 4.4%
    24-Hour CPU Usage: Usage remaining low.
    Conclusion: The CPU usage over 24 hours is minimal.
    
Memory Utilization
    Current RAM Used: 25.7% (of 31 GiB total)
    24-Hour RAM Usage: Steady usage with significant free memory available.
    Conclusion: My system has ample RAM (31 GiB total) with only about 25.7% utilized. This indicates there is sufficient memory available for Celestia node operations.

Disk I/O and Usage
    Root Filesystem Used: 6.6% of 969 GiB ( I used RAID 1)
    24-Hour Disk I/O:
        Reads Completed Mean: 153 IO/s
        Writes Completed Mean: 171 IO/s
    Max Reads and Writes: Peaks up to 4.47K IO/s and 878 IO/s respectively.
    Conclusion: The disk utilization is minimal both in terms of capacity (969 GiB total) and I/O operations. The I/O peaks are well within the VPSâ€™s capabilities.

Network Traffic
    24-Hour Network Traffic:
    Receive Traffic: Peaks below 200 Mb/s
    Transmit Traffic: Peaks below 200 Mb/s
    Conclusion: Network traffic remains within a moderate range, well below typical VPS bandwidth limits (10 to 32Gbps). This indicates that there are adequate network resources to support the Celestia validator.

Overall System Health
    My VPS has sufficient resources (CPU, memory, disk space, and network bandwidth) to handle the additional load of running a Celestia Validator.
    Given the steady and low level of resource utilization, I am confident that my VPS is well-equipped to handle running a Celestia node without compromising performance or stability.

```
CPU Utilization
    Current CPU Busy: 10.5%
    System Load: 11.0%
    24-Hour CPU Usage: Usage remaining low.
    Conclusion: The CPU utilization over the past 24 hours has been moderate, with an 8-core system providing ample capacity to accommodate the additional load of running a Celestia bridge node.

Memory Utilization
    Current RAM Used: 16.2% (of 31 GiB total)
    24-Hour RAM Usage: Steady usage well below total capacity, with significant free memory available.
    Conclusion: My system has ample RAM (31 GiB total) with only about 16.2% currently utilized. This indicates there is more than sufficient memory available for Celestia bridge node operations.

Disk I/O and Usage
    Root Filesystem Used: 52.1% of 4 TiB
    24-Hour Disk I/O:
        Reads Completed Mean: 316 IO/s
        Writes Completed Mean: 116 IO/s
        Max Reads and Writes: Peaks up to 2.50K IO/s and 2.69K IO/s respectively.
    Conclusion: The disk utilization shows moderate usage. Disk space is used at 52.1%, and the I/O operations are within acceptable limits, suggesting enough headroom for additional disk operations from the Celestia node.

Network Traffic
    24-Hour Network Traffic:
        Receive Traffic: Peaks below 20 Mb/s
        Transmit Traffic: Peaks below 20 Mb/s
    Conclusion:  Network traffic remains within a moderate range, well below typical VPS bandwidth limits (10 to 32Gbps). 

Overall System Health
    System Pressure: CPU, memory, and I/O pressures are low (CPU: 0.4%, Memory: 0.2%, I/O: 5.5%).

Summary
    Overall, with sufficiently low resource utilization in CPU, memory, disk space, and network bandwidth, my VPS has the necessary resources to handle the additional load of running a Celestia bridge node. The system metrics over the past 24 hours show moderate to low utilization in all key areas, providing assurance for the new workload.

    Given the steady resource utilization, I am confident that my VPS is well-equipped to operate a Celestia node efficiently without compromising performance or stability.
